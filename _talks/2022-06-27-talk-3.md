This talk will present a low-rank tensor method for parameterized linear fluid-structure interaction problems. In this work, the fluid is governed by the incompressible Stokes equations, and we assume a thick-walled solid model. In order to reduce the computational cost associated with the coupled problem, we develop a low-rank tensor method based on the low-rank Generalized Minimal Residual method. This one is then employed in an uncertainty quantification task to perform a large number of simulations. The preliminary results show the significant reduction of the computational cost provided by the proposed method.
