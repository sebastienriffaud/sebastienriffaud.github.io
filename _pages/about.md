I am currently a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of Prof. Fabio Nobile at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. My research activity concerns the development of low-rank dynamic approximations to accelerate data assimilation algorithms (ensemble Kalman filter, particle filter). In particular, we are investigating the estimation of the state and parameters of a reduced blood flow model (a 1D hyperbolic system modeling blood flow in the main arteries of the human body) from local measurements of the pressure and mass flux.

<p>Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of Damiano Lombardi and Miguel Fernández at Inria Paris. My work focused on the estimation of the parameters and fluid pressure of blood flow models based on FSI problems from velocity measurements, which are the data typically available in 4D-flow MRIs. In December 2020, I completed my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Angelo Iollo at Université de Bordeaux. My thesis focused on the development of projection-based reduced-order models for fluid mechanics (Boltzmann-BGK equation, compressible Euler equations).</p>
