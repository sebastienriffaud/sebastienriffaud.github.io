I am currently a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of Prof. Fabio Nobile at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. My research activity concerns the development of dynamical low-rank approximations to accelerate data assimilation algorithms (ensemble Kalman filter, particle filter).

<p>Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of Damiano Lombardi and Miguel Fernández at Inria Paris. My work focused on the estimation of the parameters and fluid pressure of FSI-based blood flow models from velocity measurements. In December 2020, I completed my PhD under the supervision of Prof. Angelo Iollo at Université de Bordeaux. My thesis focused on the development of projection-based reduced-order models for fluid mechanics (Boltzmann-BGK equation, compressible Euler equations).</p>
