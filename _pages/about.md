I am a postdoctoral researcher in applied mathematics at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland), where I work with Prof. Fabio Nobile and Prof. Jürg Schiffmann. Previously, I completed my PhD thesis in applied mathematics and scientific computing at the University of Bordeaux (France) under the supervision of Prof. Angelo Iollo, and I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Inria Paris (France) with Damiano Lombardi and Miguel Fernández.
