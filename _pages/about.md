I am currently a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of Prof. Fabio Nobile at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland). My research activity concerns the developement of dynamical low-rank approximations for accelerating data assimilation algorithms (ensemble Kalman filter, particle filter). In particular, we are investigating the estimation of
the state and parameters of a reduced blood flow model (a 1D hyperbolic system modeling the blood flow in the main arteries of the human body) from local measurements of the pressure and mass flux.

<p>Previously, I completed my PhD thesis under the direction of Prof. Angelo Iollo at Université de Bordeaux. My work focused on the development of projection-based reduced-order models for fluid mechanics (Boltzmann-BGK equation, compressible Euler equations). Then, I did a postdoctoral follow under the supervision of Damiano Lombardi and Miguel Fernández at Inria Paris (France). The objective was to estimate the parameters and fluid pressure of a blood flow model based on FSI from velocity measurements, which are the data typically available in 4D-flow MRI.</p>
